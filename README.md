CafeNest-cart is a sample Angular application designed to simulate a café ordering system. The app allows users to browse a selection of dessert items, add them to a shopping cart, adjust quantities, and place an order—all within a clean, responsive interface. Built entirely in Angular, the project demonstrates fundamental frontend development concepts such as component-based architecture, data binding, routing, and in-memory cart state management. It serves as a practical example for anyone learning Angular or building a simple e-commerce-style frontend without a backend integration.
